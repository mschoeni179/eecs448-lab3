        <p class="bio">Yuzuru Hanyu is a figure skater from Japan. He is most famous for winning
            the gold medal for the Men's Singles event in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 Winter 
            Olympics in Pyeongchang. Yuzuru Hanyu was the first man since Dick Button won back-to-back gold medals in the
            1952 and 1948 Olympics for the men's event. </p>

        <p class="pooh">At every figure skating competition Yuzuru Hanyu brings his Winnie the Pooh 
            tissue box. Winnie the Pooh has become and iconic part of his image. After he skates, fans 
            will throw hundreds of Pooh stuffed animals onto the ice.
